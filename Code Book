 ## Project Description
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

##Study design and data processing
It is required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below;
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis,and;
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

###Collection of the raw data

###Cleaning of the data
	The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:

Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt from the "./data/train" folder and store them in trainData,trainLabel and trainSubject variables respectively.
ii.	Read X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt from the "./data/test" folder and store them in testData, testLabeland testsubject variables respectively.
iii.	Concatenate testData to trainData to generate a 10299x561 data frame, joinData; concatenate testLabel totrainLabel to generate a 10299x1 data frame, joinLabel; concatenate testSubject to trainSubject to generate a 10299x1 data frame, joinSubject.
iv.	Read the features.txt file from the "/data" folder and store the data in a variable called features. We only extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. This results in a 66 indices list. We get a subset ofjoinData with the 66 corresponding columns.
v.	Clean the column names of the subset. We remove the "()" and "-" symbols in the names, as well as make the first letter of "mean" and "std" a capital letter "M" and "S" respectively.
vi.	Read the activity_labels.txt file from the "./data"" folder and store the data in a variable called activity.
vii.	Clean the activity names in the second column of activity. We first make all names to lower cases. If the name has an underscore between letters, we remove the underscore and capitalize the letter immediately after the underscore.
viii.	Transform the values of joinLabel according to the activity data frame.
ix.	Combine the joinSubject, joinLabel and joinData by column to get a new cleaned 10299x68 data frame,cleanedData. Properly name the first two columns, "subject" and "activity". The "subject" column contains integers that range from 1 to 30 inclusive; the "activity" column contains 6 kinds of activity names; the last 66 columns contain measurements that range from -1 to 1 exclusive.
x.	Write the cleanedData out to "merged_data.txt" file in current working directory.
xi.	Finally, generate a second independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject. We have 30 unique subjects and 6 unique activities, which result in a 180 combinations of the two. Then, for each combination, we calculate the mean of each measurement with the corresponding combination. So, after initializing the result data frame and performing the two for-loops, we get a 180x68 data frame.
xii.	Write the result out to "data_with_means.txt" file in current working directory.
